        <!-- Section for Bears -->
        <section>
            <h2>Bears</h2>
            <img src="img/bears.jpg" width="200" height="190" alt="Two bears playing the water"/>
            <ul>
                <li>Ollie</li>
                <p>Ollie is our male bear at this zoo. When he's not getting into play fights with his sister Mona, he loves eating salmon. Male bears typically weigh more than females and can weigh up to 1,500lbs.</p>
                <li>Mona</li>
                <p> Mona has a sassy personality and loves eating fruit. Did you know that female bears tend to be more aggresive than the males? Watch out Ollie! </p>

            <h2>Giraffes</h2>
            <img src="img/giraffes.jpg" width="200" height="190" alt="Two giraffes"/>
            <ul>
                <li>Frankie</li>
                <p>Frankie loves feeding time. During feeding hours we get to see her long purple tongue. That's right, giraffe tongues are purple! How neat!</p>
                <li>Coconut</li>
                <p>Coconut is our tallest giraffe here at the zoo. Giraffes are the tallest land mammals, they could look into a second story window with no trouble at all! How impressive!  </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Lions</h2>
            <img src="img/lion.jpg" idth="200" height="190" alt="Female and male lion"/> 
            <ul>
                <li>Mella</li>
                <p>Mella is our female lion here at the zoo. While ionesses are typically the primary hunters of the pack, Mella can simply relax here. </p>
                <li>Karl</li>
                <p>Male lions have manes that vary in sizes and colors to impress the ladies and intimidate other males. Karl's mane and sweet personality have certainly won our Mella over. </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Cookie</li>
                <p>In the wild, female monkeys tend to live up to 45 years! While Cookie may get older, we think she'll always keep that playful spirit. </p>
                <li>Earl</li>
                <p>Earl is our tedious male monkey. Monkeys tend to build new nests every night for sleeping, and our Earl takes this very seriously!</p>
